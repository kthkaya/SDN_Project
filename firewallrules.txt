Firewall 1:

  ICMP
========
1.	H1 (100.0.0.10) and H2 (100.0.0.11) can ping LB1 (100.0.0.25) and vice versa. This includes request and response
2.	H1 (100.0.0.10) and H2 (100.0.0.11) can ping LB2 (100.0.0.45) and vice versa. This includes request and response
3.  H1 (100.0.0.10) and H2 (100.0.0.11) can ping only NAPT EXT Interface (100.0.0.1). Note: exclusive rule to block the icmp request from public zone towards private zone is installed in Firewall2!
   UDP  
=========
3.	UDP service is accessible on “DNS server” on port 53.
•	HOSTS can establish UDP connection (srcip: -, srcprt: - ::: dstip: 100.0.0.25 dstprt: 53)
4.	TCP service is accessible from “HTTP service” on port 80.
•	HOSTS can establish TCP connection (srcip: -, srcprt: - ::: dstip: 100.0.0.45, dstprt: 80)
Imp: Rest other traffic is blocked!

Firewall 2:

   ICMP
=========
1.	PH (100.0.0.1) can initiate ping to H1 (100.0.0.10), H2 (100.0.0.11), LB1 (100.0.0.25), LB2 (100.0.0.45)
2.  Outside to PH - Only responses should be allowed

   UDP
========
1.	PH (100.0.0.1) can establish UDP connection to LB1 (100.0.0.25 - 53)
2.  PH (100.0.0.1) can establish UDP connection with H1 (100.0.0.10) and H2 (100.0.0.11) on all ports
3.  Outside to PH - Only incoming UDP packets are allowed

   TCP
========
1.	PH (100.0.0.1) can establish TCP connection to LB2 (100.0.0.45 - 80)
2.  PH (100.0.0.1) can establish TCP connection with H1 (100.0.0.10) and H2 (100.0.0.11) on all ports
3.  Outside to PH - Only incoming TCP packets are allowed

Note: Here src-ip is the ip given by napt after translation, i.e., 100.0.0.1. This will be my srcip for private zone. Let’s consider this as PH (private host)
